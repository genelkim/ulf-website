<h2>A Primal Logical Form for Episodic Logic</h2>

<p>The equation below is just here for now as a MathJax reference…
When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}</script>

<p>Welcome to the ULF project page!  This project is aimed at formulating, annotating,
and parsing so-called <em>unscoped logical forms</em>, which is representation for naturally
capturing the semantic type structure of language within the framework of Episodic
Logic.  Aspects of meaning unrelated to the semantic type structure are largely left
ambiguous in ULFs for resolution in later steps.  The purpose of this is to have a
semantic representation that can be quickly annotated by people and then precisely
parsed using the current state-of-the-art techniques.  Take a look at a couple English
sentences and corresponding ULFs.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Could you dial for me?
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(((pres could.aux-v) you.pro ((dial.v {ref1}.pro) 
                              (adv-a (for.p me.pro)))) ?)
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>If I were you I would be able to succeed
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>((if.ps (I.pro ((cf were.v) (= you.pro))))
 (I.pro ((cf will.aux-s) (be.v (able.a (to succeed.v))))))
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The dot-extensions <code class="highlighter-rouge">.n</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">.v</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">.a</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">.p</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">.aux-s</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.pro</code> are named in relation
to their syntactic part-of-speech correspondents (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.).<br />
Furthermore, if you’re familiar with constituency tree, you might have noticed that 
the general structures of these formulas have a lot in common with them.  For example,
“for me” makes a single constituent, which is a prepositional phrase in constituency
trees.  Similarly, “dial for me”, “will be able to succeed” are both single constituents
that correspond to verb phrases.  This sort of correspondence means that we can expect 
annotating and learning parsers for ULFs shouldn’t be too much of a stretch beyond 
constituency parsing, for which research has been very successful.</p>

<p>Despite the surface similarity, ULFs are not syntax.  The underlying Episodic
Logic type system means that there are specific formal meanings and
restrictions to the compositions in these formulas.  <code class="highlighter-rouge">.pro</code> correspond to
individuals in the domain, whereas <code class="highlighter-rouge">.n</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">.a</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.v</code> correspond to
predicates of varying adicity.  This is why we need operators like <code class="highlighter-rouge">adv-a</code> are
necessary for shifting the types appropriately.  ULFs are useful both for
further resolution of ambiguity towards full Episodic Logic (as the name ULF
suggests, one of these resolution steps is scoping) and immediate inference
from ULFs.  The closeness of ULF to syntax allows it to be used in Natural
Logic-like inferences, which are inference derived from syntactic structure,
polarity context, and specificity-relations between words and phrases.  The
semantic types of ULFs also allows it to make forward inferences in a manner
similar to Episodic Logic, while attending to the locations of remaining
ambiguity.</p>

<p>Learning a precise parser for ULFs would be a step toward a comprehensive
semantic parser for a rich, model-theoretic semantic representation.  We
expect that a representation like this is necessary for general and robust
understanding and reasoning over natural language.</p>
